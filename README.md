# Ingenuity Through Laziness Project

## Turning laziness into efficiency.

This project was born out of a need to generate realistic camouflage patterns for the popular "milsim" video game [ArmA 3](https://www.arma3.com). 

I wanted to create a process that would allow the use of easy-to-generate inputs, neural networks, image processing, and easy configuration and regeneration.

As I develop the process, this page will include various resources and references that I use to develop a final product.
